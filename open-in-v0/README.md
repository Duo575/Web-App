# v0 Development Version

This folder contains a Next.js version of the portfolio website, likely created using v0.dev (Vercel's AI-powered frontend development tool).

## Purpose

- Alternative implementation using Next.js framework
- Comparison/testing version alongside the main Vite+React version
- Possible migration path or feature testing environment

## Structure

- Built with Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS
- Uses pnpm as package manager
- Contains UI components and theme provider
- Includes compare demo functionality

## Usage

```bash
cd open-in-v0
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Relationship to Main Project

This is a supplementary version of the main portfolio website located in the parent directory. The main project uses Vite+React while this version uses Next.js.

Both versions share similar:

- Design principles (night sky theme)
- TailwindCSS styling
- Component architecture
- UI/UX patterns

_Note: This folder is kept as part of the project per user preference. It does not interfere with the main Vite+React implementation._
