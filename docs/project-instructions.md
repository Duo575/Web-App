## 🤖 **AI Assistant Behavioral Instructions**

### **❓ Communication & Clarification Protocol**

**ALWAYS ASK FOR CLARIFICATION WHEN:**

- Requirements are unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous
- Multiple implementation approaches are possible
- User intent is uncertain or could be interpreted differently
- Technical decisions could impact future development
- Design choices have multiple valid options

**CLARIFICATION PROCESS:**

1. **Pause development** - Don't proceed with assumptions
2. **Ask specific questions** - Provide 2-4 numbered options when applicable
3. **Explain the impact** - Why the clarification matters
4. **Wait for user response** - Before continuing implementation
5. **Confirm understanding** - Repeat back the decision for verification

### **💬 Communication Style Preferences**

- **Be helpful and thorough** - Provide complete solutions
- **Ask targeted questions** - One critical aspect at a time
- **Provide context** - Explain why clarification is needed
- **Offer options** - Give 2-4 specific choices when possible
- **Keep conversations focused** - Don't overwhelm with too many questions
- **Confirm before proceeding** - Ensure understanding before implementation

### **🔍 Doubt Resolution Examples**

**Instead of assuming:**

```
"I'll create a button component with these styles..."
```

**Always clarify:**

```
"Before creating the button component, I need clarification:
What button variants do you need?
1. Primary (gradient background)
2. Secondary (outline style)
3. Text-only (minimal style)
4. Icon button (with icon support)
```

**When technical choices arise:**

```
"For the mobile menu implementation, which approach do you prefer?
1. Slide-in from right side
2. Full-screen overlay
3. Dropdown from top
4. Bottom sheet modal
```

### **🛠️ Working Methodology**

**FILE HANDLING:**

- **Always re-read changed files** - If user modifies files, re-read before proceeding
- **Use absolute paths** - Always use full paths: `a:/OneDrive/Desktop/Folders/Project/Portfolio website/Website/`
- **Check file status** - Verify file exists and content before editing
- **Maintain file structure** - Follow established naming conventions and folder organization

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:**

- **User-driven development** - Wait for user instructions before major changes
- **Incremental improvements** - Small, focused changes rather than massive rewrites
- **Test each change** - Ensure functionality works before moving to next feature
- **Document all changes** - Update relevant documentation files
- **Preserve user customizations** - Don't overwrite user's custom modifications

**PROBLEM SOLVING:**

- **Identify root cause** - Don't just fix symptoms
- **Provide complete solutions** - Include all necessary files and dependencies
- **Explain the fix** - Help user understand what was changed and why
- **Offer alternatives** - When multiple solutions exist, present options

### **👤 User-Specific Preferences**

**COMMUNICATION STYLE:**

- User prefers thorough explanations and complete solutions
- Appreciates step-by-step guidance and clear instructions
- Values documentation and organized project structure
- Likes to see progress tracking and current status updates

**TECHNICAL PREFERENCES:**

- Modern tech stack with latest versions (React 19, etc.)
- Clean, well-organized code structure
- TypeScript for type safety
- Responsive, mobile-first design approach
- Professional, elegant design aesthetics

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT:**

- Phase-based development approach
- Regular status updates and documentation
- Clear roadmap with completed/pending features
- Comprehensive instruction documentation for future reference

**DECISION MAKING:**

- Prefers to be consulted on major technical decisions
- Wants to review and approve changes before implementation
- Values having options presented with clear pros/cons
- Appreciates when AI assistant asks for clarification rather than making assumptions

## 📋 **Additional Notes**

### **Compatibility Requirements**

- Node.js 18+
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Install dependencies with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for React 19 compatibility

### **Development Environment**

- Visual Studio Code recommended
